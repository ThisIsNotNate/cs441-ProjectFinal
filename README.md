Created 3D isometric tetris in unity for android

Used Probuilder for model creation. Used Github for Unity plugin to manage commits. Move your quadris pieces around in an isometric perspective. Controls on the left move the piece and the controls on the right to rotate the piece. The two larger buttons above rotate the perspective to the next corner of the board.

Main issues in development have been with collision management and creating colliders to the shapes of the pieces. All code done in development is in C# scripts attached to objects in the scene.
